### Overview

Translate is an android app to translate text conversations, supporting 90+ languages with support for speech-to-text and text-to-speech for ease of accessibility.
The app provides 2 modes of translation: 

- **Direct Mode** provides quick and easy translation, much like simple translators. Language pair and text can be swapped quickly.
- **Conversation Mode** provides parallel translation in chat format acting as a handy translator between two users for continous conversation.
